// This file contains a Base64 representation of the Cairo-Regular font.
// It's used by jsPDF to render Arabic characters correctly in the generated PDF report.
// The font can be downloaded from Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cairo
// To generate this file:
// 1. Download the .ttf file.
// 2. Use a tool (e.g., an online converter or a local script) to convert the TTF to a Base64 string.
// 3. Paste the Base64 string into this file.

export const arabicFont = 
'AAEAAAARAQAABAAQRFNJRwAAAAAAA... (This would be a very long Base64 string, I will use a placeholder here for brevity, but a real implementation requires the full string)';
